## 0937. Reorder Data in Log Files

https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-data-in-log-files/




### Description

> You have an array of `logs`. Each log is a space delimited string of words.
>
> For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric *identifier*. Then, either:
>
> - Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
> - Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
>
> We will call these two varieties of logs *letter-logs* and *digit-logs*. It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.
>
> Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log. The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties. The digit-logs should be put in their original order.
>
> Return the final order of the logs.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
> Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> 1. `0 <= logs.length <= 100`
> 2. `3 <= logs[i].length <= 100`
> 3. `logs[i]` is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.
>

### Solution

------

#### First thought

Split the string on the fist space, so we will get the identifier and the detail.

Sort the detail fro letter-logs.

Digit-logs remain in the same order.



Python3:

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        def f(log):
            identifier, detail = log.split(" ", 1)
            if detail[0].isalpha():
                return (0, detail, identifier)
            else:
                return (1,)

        return (sorted(logs, key = f))
```

```
["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo","a2 act car"]
```
