## 1099. Two Sum Less Than K

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-less-than-k/




### Description

> Given an array `A` of integers and integer `K`, return the maximum `S` such that there exists `i < j` with `A[i] + A[j] = S` and `S < K`. If no `i, j`exist satisfying this equation, return -1.
>
> Example 1:
>
> ```
>Input: A = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], K = 60
> Output: 58
> Explanation: 
> We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.
> ```
> 
>    Example 2:
>    
>    ```
>    Input: A = [10,20,30], K = 15
>    Output: -1
>    Explanation: 
>    In this case it's not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.
>    ```
>    
>    Note:
>    
>    1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
>    2. `1 <= A[i] <= 1000`
>    3. `1 <= K <= 2000`
>

### Solution

------

#### First thought

Use two loops to traverse every sum. Return the max number.

Python3:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSumLessThanK(self, a:list[int], k:int)->int:
        result = -1
        for i in range(len(a)):
          for j in range(i, len(a)):
            if a[i]+a[j] < k:
              result = max(result, a[i]+a[j])
        return result
```

```
[34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8]
60
[10,20]
15
[]
5
```

```
N/A

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```



#### Improvement

Usually two pointers will be a good solution for array that needs to find something max. Here, we have to sort the array first

Python3:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSumLessThanK2(self, a:list[int], k:int)->int:
        result = -1
        a.sort()
        left = 0
        right = len(a) - 1
        while left < right:
          if a[left] + a[right] < k:
            result = a[left] + a[right]
            left += 1
          else:
            right -= 1
        return result
    
```

```
[34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8]
60
[10,20]
15
[]
5
```

```
N/A


Time Complexity: O(log n) because of sort()
Space Complexity: O(1)
```
