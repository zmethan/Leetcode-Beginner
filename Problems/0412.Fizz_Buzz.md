## 412. Fizz Buzz 

https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/ 



### Description

> Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to *n*.
>
> But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> n = 15,
> 
> Return:
> [
>     "1",
>     "2",
>     "Fizz",
>     "4",
>     "Buzz",
>     "Fizz",
>     "7",
>     "8",
>     "Fizz",
>     "Buzz",
>     "11",
>     "Fizz",
>     "13",
>     "14",
>     "FizzBuzz"
> ]
> ```



### Solution

------

#### First thought

Use a loop and modulus to traverse every number. Append it to the list.

Python3:

```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
                result.append("FizzBuzz")
            elif i%3 == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            elif i%5 == 0:
                result.append("Buzz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))
        return result
                
```

```
15
0
1
-15
```

```
Runtime: 40 ms, faster than 96.20% of Python3 online submissions for Fizz Buzz.
Memory Usage: 13.8 MB, less than 100.00% of Python3 online submissions for Fizz Buzz.


Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```



#### Improvement

What if we need more mapping than only 'Fizz' and 'Buzz'? Writing the condition inside the loop is hard to maintain if spec changes. Putting them into a hash table would be more ideal.

Also, by reducing the condition,  we should use "Fizz" + "Buzz" instead of "FizzBuzz"  for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5.

Python3:

```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        m = {
            3:"Fizz",
            5:"Buzz"
        }
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            temp = ""
            for key in m:
                if i%key == 0:
                    temp += m[key]
            if not temp:
                temp = str(i)
            result.append(temp)
        return result
    
```

```

0
1
-15
```

```
